# Epidemiology_And_Disease_Spread
When a disease spreads in a population, it's crucial to understand how it moves from person to person(or Location to Location). This is where graph theory becomes useful.
Graph Basics:
Nodes: Represent individuals, locations, or entities.
Edges: Represent the connections between nodes (e.g., interactions between individuals/Locations).

Contact Network:
A graph can model the interactions in a population. For example, in Hyderabad, each person can be a node/Location can be a Node, and an edge can represent a close contact or interaction where disease transmission can occur. Identifying articulation points becomes essential for understanding critical locations or individuals that can significantly influence the spread of infections. The goal is to pinpoint locations or individuals whose removal(Lockdown) could lead to a more fragmented network, potentially slowing down the spread of the disease. 

Example: COVID-19 in Hyderabad

Step 1: Data Collection
Gather Data:
Collect data on individuals' movements(or Locations), interactions, and COVID-19 cases in Hyderabad.
Sources: Contact tracing apps, mobile phone data, health records, and social networks.
Build the Graph:
Create a graph where each node represents a person in Hyderabad.
Draw edges between nodes if there has been an interaction between those individuals.

Step 2: Identify Key Points
Central Nodes:
Identify individuals with the most connections (high degree). These are "super spreaders" who can infect many others.
Articulation Points:
These are critical nodes whose removal would significantly disrupt the graph. In epidemiology, these points can be key locations or individuals whose isolation would break the chain of transmission.

Step 3: Disease Control Strategy:

Simulate Spread:
Use the graph to simulate how COVID-19 spreads from person to person.
Apply epidemiological models like SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) to see how the disease propagates through the network.

Step 4: Intervene at Key Points:

Target Interventions:
Vaccination: Prioritize vaccination for central nodes (super spreaders) and individuals at articulation points to prevent the disease from spreading rapidly.
Testing and Quarantine: Increase testing and quarantine efforts for these key individuals or locations.
Monitor and Control:
Continuous monitoring of the network to identify new key nodes as the situation evolves.
Use real-time data to adjust strategies, such as imposing localized lockdowns or travel restrictions in specific neighborhoods of Hyderabad.

Example Scenario in Hyderabad

Building the Contact Network:
Suppose we collect data on individuals in Hyderabad. Person A interacts with Persons B, C, and D; Person B interacts with Persons A and E, and so on.
We build a graph where nodes are people and edges represent interactions. 

Identifying Super Spreaders and Articulation Points:
Through analysis, we find Person A has many connections (super spreader) and that removing Person C (an articulation point) would break the network into smaller parts, reducing the disease's spread potential.

Simulating and Intervening:
Simulate disease spread starting from an infected individual and observe how it moves through the network.
Prioritize vaccinating Person A and isolating Person C to significantly control the spread.
Implement testing and quarantine around the neighborhoods of Persons A and C.

Tools and Technologies
Graph Visualization Software: Tools that can help visualize and analyze the contact network.
Epidemiological Models: Use models like SIR or SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) to simulate and predict disease spread.
Data Sources: Leverage data from contact tracing apps, health databases, and mobility data.

Summary

1. Collect Data: Gather interaction and mobility data between Locations/Individuals.
2. Build Graph: Model the population/Locations as a graph.
3. Identify Key Points: Find super spreaders and articulation points.
4. Simulate Spread: Use epidemiological models to predict disease spread.
5. Intervene: Target vaccinations, testing, and quarantines at key points.
6. Monitor: Continuously monitor and adjust strategies based on real-time data.

Identify Potential Super Spreaders:

To identify potential super spreaders, you can look at nodes (areas) with high population and high degree (number of connections). Here's how you might approach this in Java:
Track the population for each node.
Identify nodes with high population.
Identify nodes with high degree.
Prioritize nodes that meet both criteria for vaccination.
